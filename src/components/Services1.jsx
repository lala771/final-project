            Trying too many scents at the same time can be extremely overwhelming, and that’s why it’s key to take a break and come back later to make a purchase, or alternatively take some samples home to try over a period of time. 

Due to the journey the perfume goes through once it makes contact with your skin, it’s integral for you to test your perfume of choice prior to making the purchase

            <h2>HELPING YOU TO CHOOSE YOUR SIGNITUE</h2>
            <p>
            Choosing the right perfume is a very personal journey for everyone. It’s not as easy as reading reviews online, ordering a bottle and hoping for the best, you have to understand the fragrance notes and families, i.e., asking yourself important questions such as if you like floral notes, citrus notes or stronger scents like oud. It all depends on what appeases your senses and ultimately, what suits your personality.
